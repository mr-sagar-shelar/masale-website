For example most SQL databases accept select statements starting with select, SELECT or even SeLeCt.
In case you want to provide your users the same flexibility with your language, there are different levels of case-insensitivity in Langium:
You can make Langium&amp;rsquo;s parser completely case insensitive using the language configuration You can include case-insensitivity for specific terminal rules You can make cross references case insensitive All of these options can be enabled independent of one another.</description></item></channel></rss>
